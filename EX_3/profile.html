	<h1>Dexter</h1>
	<img src="dexter.png" class="center" id=1>
	<p>This dark, handsom ball of fluff is the one and only Dexter! He not only the coolest cat around town (don't tell his brother I said this,) but he is also the derpiest. Dexter loves to wake his human's up at 7:00 am with impresive high range meows, seeking pets and attention.
		 Although he is a chonker, Dexter is most well known for his graceful leaps and mad laser pointer pouncing skills. Dexter is the best furry friend a girl can ask for.</p>
